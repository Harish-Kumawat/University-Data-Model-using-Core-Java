# University-Data-Model-using-Core-Java

A *Core Java based University Data Model* project that represents the internal structure of a university using *Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)* concepts.

This project focuses on modeling real-world university entities and their relationships through Java classes and objects.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

The project demonstrates a hierarchical data model of a university with the following structure:

University  
→ College  
→ Department  
→ Division  
→ Student  

Each level is connected using *Has-A relationships (composition)* to show how data flows between objects in a real-world system.
